<p class="vwo_group_1369648094844_0"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><i>Why are most people, despite working out still experiencing nagging pains on an every day basis?&#8217;? </i></span></p>
<p>Well, for one thing, the science behind it is very new that no one (not even personal trainers or fitness &#8216;gurus&#8217;? ) have had access to the information you&#8217;re about to read until now.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s just human nature to &#8216;keep on driving&#8217;?  when they see the check oil light turn on in their car, meaning</p>
<p>That you are probably experience some small nagging pain in your bodies but end up shrugging it offuntil it ultimately gets serious, and your forced to do something or face the consequences</p>
<p>This is what happened to meand it&#8217;s most certainly happening to millions of people throughout world.</p>
<p>Look, exercising is an ingrained habit in my life. I just love it when I get an intense, sweaty workout in the gym or even at home. I get even more satisfaction when I&#8217;m able to break my own personal lifting records, and see actual progress when I weight lift.</p>
<p>I do all of this while still enjoying an active life that involves plenty of time with my friends, playing sports and spending quality time with my baby nephew and two god daughters.<br />
<!-- NOW YOU MIGHT BE THINKING ENDS HERE --></p>
<p><!-- BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THIS WAY STARTS HERE --></p>
<p class="vwo_1369611425631 vwo_1369648095574" style="font-size: 32px;"><strong>But It Wasn&#8217;t Always This Way</strong></p>
<p>You see, back when I was 21 years old I thought I was &#8216;Superman&#8217;? .</p>
<p>No, I didn&#8217;t think I was able to fly nor did I think I would have x-ray vision (that would&#8217;ve been great in college) but I thought that I&#8217;d always have a healthy functioning body that would never &#8216;age&#8217;?  and that I would never be seriously get injured.</p>
<p>I also came from a small town in Ontario called Markham which at the time was almost like a spitting image of Smallville back then.</p>
<p>On my free time I was always looking for ways to push my physical limits in every single way possible. Whether it was lifting weights, playing sports, and just causing trouble when I was a kid.</p>
<p>At times we&#8217;d be so crazy that we&#8217;d pretend to be stuntmen and have one of our friends drive a car full speed while I&#8217;d hold onto the top for dear life. It&#8217;s surprising that I didn&#8217;t break a neck back then.</p>
<p>I also had a high tolerance to pain. I&#8217;d feel small pains on my body but I&#8217;d disregard it and be able to work through them.</p>
<p>I thought,</p>
<p style="font-size: 24px;">&#8216;<i>Hey it&#8217;s normal for everyone to feel a little pain in their bodyright?</i>&#8216;? </p>
<div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/003_LowerBackPain.png" width="320" /></div>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know that at the time, this mentality would be the cause of my downfall.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d always felt pain in some area of my body whether it was my shoulders or lower back. As always I brushed it off and made jokes to my friends that, at 21 years old, I was &#8216;getting old&#8217;? .</p>
<p>Then one day while I was doing deadlifts at the gym I felt a <i>tweak</i> in my lower back. Something about it didn&#8217;t feel right. I didn&#8217;t think anything of it and just kept on pushing through the workout.</p>
<p>The tweak in my lower back never went away but I still hit the gym 3 days a week to workout. I pushed through the pain even though it got more PAINFUL.</p>
<p>With every workout my body was getting more and more wrecked which inevitably lead me to having the movement patterns of an 80 year old man. I was also getting weaker in the gym yet I didn&#8217;t know what was happening</p>
<p>As I was working through my back pain, more shoulder issues started to happen as a result of focusing too much on upper body exercises.</p>
<p>I grudgingly kept on pushing through and continued to workout. It didn&#8217;t matter to me because in my head nothing seriously bad would ever happen to me.</p>
<p>Boy was I ever wrong</p>
<p>After years of suffering through painful workout after workout and seeing my performance decrease in the gym it came to a point where the pain was unbearable. Even getting up off the couch was a painful process.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d move around like I was a 80 year old man who had hip surgery but, the funny thing way, at the time I was only 22 years old.</p>
<p>It got so bad that I had to make the decision to quit the one thing that was giving me the most joy in lifethe gym.</p>
<p>I needed help so I did what everyone did back then: I sought help from a &#8216;professional&#8217;? .<br />
<!-- BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS THIS WAY ENDS HERE --><br />
<!-- $75 A WEEK STARTS HERE --></p>
<p class="vwo_1369611445571 vwo_1369648095643" style="font-size: 32px; text-align: center;"><strong>$75 a Week For The Rest of My Life? No Thank You!</strong></p>
<div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/004_MoneyBag.png" width="320" /></div>
<p>In my quest to heal my body I went to see numerous chiropractors and physiotherapists. But they all told me different things:</p>
<p>One physiotherapist said, in what I can only explain as &#8216;medical language&#8217;? , said something that I can&#8217;t remember but it was really smart.</p>
<p>I swear they use big medical terms just to confuse you.</p>
<p>A chiropractor told me that I had a spine that curved in one direction causing my problems and that by the time I was 30 I wouldn&#8217;t be able to walkwithout the help of his adjustments of course.</p>
<p>All of the causes they gave me were all different, except for one thing.</p>
<p>That whatever the &#8217;cause&#8217;?  was ailing me, that I would have to shell out $75 or more a week to get treated by themand that I&#8217;d have to do it for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Obviously, I declined all offers.</p>
<p>Yet, I needed the gym back in my life. I felt like I was getting fatter and saggy&#8217;er as I spent more days I spent away from the gym. So after a few of weeks of rest I decided to hit the gym again in &#8216;hopes&#8217;?  that my problems would go away.</p>
<p>I remember that session like it was yesterday.</p>
<p>I hit my first couple of sets and, while it was painful, I got through my workout with just a light touch pain in my shoulders and back. I thought this was okay so I kept going.</p>
<p>Once I got through the entire workout I was happy. Even though I felt a little pain it was as bad as it was before. It was encouraging.</p>
<p>I remember going to to sleep all excited thinking, &#8216;<i>I&#8217;m healed!</i>&#8216;? </p>
<p>Little did I know.</p>
<p>At about 2am at night, I was woken up by a stinging pain in my shoulder and an even sharper pain in my lower back. I literally could not sleep nor could I get out of the bed without hurting myself. Putting pressure on either part of my body ended up in excruciating pain, which left me almost in tears.<br />

<p>I had to do somethingbut what?</p>

<p class="vwo_1369648095937">As my body worsened I pretty much had no choice but to stop all forms of physical activity, which actually turned out to be a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>Even though I was working a 9 to 5 job, most of my free time had been spent in the gym. Since I wasn&#8217;t at the gym anymore I decided to use my free time to researching and studying the intricacies of the human body.</p>
<div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/005_DieTrying.png" /></div>
<p>I decided then and there that I would research my solution or <b>DIE TRYING.</b></p>
<p>So I poured myself into studying and invested my money into the BEST books on fitness and performance.</p>
<p class="vwo_1369648092866">I spent the bulk of my time in the library researching and spent thousands of my hard earned dollars on education trying to learn what the best coaches in the world did with their athletes and clients.</p>
<p>There had to be some <i>secret</i> way of working out that kept them in tip-top shape.</p>
<p class="vwo_1369648092871">I would take their theories and then painfully apply their techniques with little to no effect on my body.</p>
<p>It was a cycle where I would learn, apply, then get frustrated when their &#8216;solution&#8217;?  didn&#8217;t work. It was getting nowhere and I was about to give up.</p>
<p>But I couldn&#8217;t give up. I had to keep on going.</p>
<p>There was still something I was missing, something that I wasn&#8217;t doingand it hiding underneath my nose the whole time.</p>

<p>I remember that at the time I was really into self development tapes. I was listening to one tape by a guy named Jim Rohn and he would always have a saying, &#8216;<i>Success leaves clues</i>&#8216;? </p>
<p>If I was to find the solution then I couldn&#8217;t keep on reading the same books everyone else was reading.</p>
<p>If I was to get back into the gym I knew I had to go where the &#8216;success&#8217;?  cases were.<br />

<div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/006_BaseBall.png" /></div>
<p class="vwo_1369648092861">One thing you must know about me is that when I get obsessed about a particular subject I go pretty overboard.</p>
<p>In my quest to find the solution my desk was littered with note after note and book after book on all subjects relating to the human body. But so far none of them contained the answer I was looking for.</p>
<p>Then one night, during a late evening researching, in a bout of frustration I buried my face into my pile of notes. It was late and I needed to sleep but I refused. I took a couple deep breaths and forced myself back up and back into study mode.</p>
<p>It was when I looked up that I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">found a clue </span>that would change my life FOREVER.</p>
<p>It was an article of a workout program for a professional baseball athlete that I had gotten from the internet.</p>
<p>What struck me was that he was on the road to recovery and he was coming back from injuries that were eerily similar to mine. He had a very unique program that involved an exercise sequence I&#8217;ve never heard of before.</p>
<p>The article for the program was done exactly one year ago and at the time of reading it he was in the All Star game and considered one of the best players for his position.</p>
<p>I decided to dive deeper.</p>
<p>There was a different article on a professional female tennis player using the very same unique sequence swearing that it kept her injury free and playing at her best for her entire career</p>
<p>And then another article on a NBA basketball player who had suffered through serious lower back and ankle injuries and is now STILL playing at his best well into his 40&#8217;s.</p>
<p>He swore that by doing program with the same workout sequence he was able to never fear getting injured again.</p>
<p>It was a performance formula that most people had no clue about yet didn&#8217;t have to do with injecting needles into their bodies, getting risky surgery or taking expensive supplements.</p>
<p>From what I discovered it was quick to do and worked almost instantly to keep these pros at their best.<br />
<!-- HOW A BASEBALL PLAYER CHANGED MY LIFE ENDS HERE --></p>
<p><!-- SUCCESS WAS LEAVING CLUES... NEW OBSESSION STARTS HERE --></p>
<p style="font-size: 24px;">Success was leaving clues and that was the beginning of my <b>new obsession.</b></p>
<div style="float: left;"><img alt="Guy doing crossfit workout" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/007_NewObsession.png" /></div>
<p>I spent the next few months investing more time and money into my studies researching this weird performance secret. After those months of research I decided</p>
<p><b>It was time to put it to the test.</b></p>
<p>I started to use this Peak Performance Formula on my own body. I treated it like a scientific experiment and put it to the test for 2 weeks and then I&#8217;d put promise myself to get back into the gym to &#8216;test&#8217;?  a full workout.</p>
<p>The two week test was almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>After spending two week applying this performance formula to my body I stopped feeling pain in any part of my body.</p>
<p>What was even more surprising was that I was moving around with more freedom and vitality than I&#8217;ve ever experienced before.</p>
<p>There was no more limited range of motion and I no longer moved like an &#8216;old&#8217;?  man. The cool thing was that I could bend down and pick things up without feeling pain in my back or shoulders.</p>
<p>After the test I was feeling more confident so I decided that I&#8217;d test my newfound body and go back to the gym.</p>
<p>What happened next was even MORE amazing</p>
<p>I remember hitting my first set, then second set, eventually going through my whole program feeling like I haven&#8217;t missed a beateven though I had been gone for an ENTIRE year.</p>
<p>I was feeling so confident in my body that I even managed to set a personal record on my squat and press and even ran faster intervals on the treadmills with complete ease.</p>
<p>It was as if I felt like my body was injected with some sort of performance enhancing drug.</p>
<p>In that workout I hit every exercise with incredible INTENSITY and <i>surprisingly</i> I still had more in my tank right even after I was done my workout.</p>
<p>The weirdest part was that even after my workout I felt amazing. After years of working out with injuries this was like being in the Twilight Zone. I could do exercises that I had not done for years <span style="text-decoration: underline;">stronger than ever</span> with complete absence of pain.<br />
<!-- SUCCESS WAS LEAVING CLUES... NEW OBSESSION ENDS HERE --></p>

<p class="vwo_1369611936138 vwo_1369648096164" style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center;"><strong>My Stamina and Energy Levels Were Going Through the Roof!</strong></p>
<div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/008_Stamina.png" /></div>
<p>I felt way better than I ever had in my entire life. It was like my body was enhanced by these few simple exercises.</p>
<p>As I made a comeback in the gym and utilized these simple shifts to the way I worked out, I became much happier.</p>
<p>I was also more physically able than I had been in my entire life &#8216; and ever since I applied the Peak Performance Formula to my body I&#8217;ve never experienced pain or the nagging injuries that had been plaguing me from before.</p>
<p>Most importantly, my newfound &#8216;superhuman-like&#8217;?  body gave me increased confidence in my body , and this poured over into personal life.</p>
<p>So much so that I decided to ditch my 9 to 5 and become a personal trainer dedicated to helping people see the same changes I&#8217;ve seen in my life. And eventually I&#8217;d start my own personal transformation business.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve used my obsession for fitness and performance to help thousands of men and women change their bodies through the use of the very same fitness principles.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s lead me to being featured in many publications, and numerous TV shows such as<br />
Not bad for a small town boy from Markham <img class="wp-smiley" alt=":)" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" /></p>

<div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/009_Fault.png" /></div>
<p>The bottom line is that people who are professionally paid athletes and the wealthy have better access to information than you do especially about what works for creating a optimally functioning body.</p>
<p>They pay big money to have athletic trainers, nutritionists on hand, and doctors watching their every move so it&#8217;s no surprise that they are able to live life and perform at an optimal level day in and day out.</p>
<p>The fact is, you don&#8217;t need to invest your time or money into any of that stuff. I&#8217;ve taken the principles of what makes the human body function at an optimal rate and took the best parts of what makes an athlete&#8217;s performance superior.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to toot my own horn but the information you are about to read will <b>instantly enhance</b> <b>the way your body moves</b> for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re sitting there right now, feeling weak and frustrated with your slow progress in the gymIf you&#8217;re just plain sick and tired of working out with constant pain in your bodyor if you just want to reverse the aging process and live your life at a higher level</p>

Slowly but surely the car will break down. It will start with a strange ringing noise in your hood and eventually</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll get to a point where you&#8217;ll have to take it to the mechanic and get the engine replaced.</p>
<p>What you don&#8217;t realize is that this is EXACTLY what you are doing to your body <b>every time</b> you put it through an intense workout.</p>
<p>Every day you sit down for long periods of time, no matter how ergonomic your chair is, you are effectively <i>killing your posture</i> and you take your broken posture to the gym through a battery of intense exercises for 45 minutes.</p>
<p class="vwo_1369612369682 vwo_1369648097071"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Bad Posture is defined as:</strong></span></p>
<div class="roundbox">A state of skeletal and muscular balance and alignment that protects the supporting structures of the body from <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">progressive deformity and injury.</span></b></div>
<p>Bad posture from sitting is the result of certain muscles <i>tightening</i> up or <i>shortening</i> while others lengthen and become weak which often occurs as a result of one&#8217;s daily activities, namely their jobs.</p>
<p>In other words, through years of working the 9 to 5, sitting down to watch TV and browsing the internet your muscles have slowly become <span style="text-decoration: underline;">progressively deformed</span>.</p>
<p>Poor posture affects everything you do in life from working out in the gym, getting out of bed in the morning to just bending down and picking your kid up off the ground.</p>
<p>A bad postural environment is literally like a molotov cocktail waging war on your body and it slowly kills you by SPEEDING up the process of aging.</p>
<div class="roundbox">One study found that when you have poor posture (aka postural dysfunction), there is an imperfect relationship among various skeletal structures of the body, and this produces an entire strain on the body&#8217;s supporting framework (<b>Britnell et al. 2005</b>).</div>
<p>Any restriction on your posture will have a NEGATIVE effect on the freedom of any movement do and you further make this an issue by making your body perform intense workout sessions 3+ days a week.</p>
<p>No wonder chiropractors are more busier NOW than they have ever been in their 100 year existence.<br />

<p>Don&#8217;t you find it weird that at this moment the popularity of chiropractors is at an all-time high?</p>
<p>80% of North Americans suffer from back, shoulder or knee pain at some point of their lives and more than 20 million North Americans will seek chiropractic care this year.</p>
<p>Why do you think this is?</p>
<p>Look no further than the chair you are currently sitting on.</p>
<p>Plain and simple your posture affects everything you do in life and if not treated you&#8217;ll always be living life in a weakened state and possibly setting yourself for serious chronic injuries (if you don&#8217;t already have them).<br />

<p>You don&#8217;t need an expensive gym membership, and even better, once you know this secret you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> have to see another physiotherapist, massage therapist, or chiropractor EVER again.<br />
<!-- THE BIGGEST LIE ABOUT "AGING" STARTS HERE --><br />
<!-- THE PEAK PERFORMANCE FORMULA IS... STARTS HERE --></p>
<p class="vwo_1369612246208 vwo_1369648096777" style="font-size: 32px; text-align: center;"><strong>The Peak Performance Formula is Available to Everyone, Anytime, and Anywhere.</strong></p>

In fact, it&#8217;s an idea that not even many of the so-called gurus or experts fully understand, which is why you don&#8217;t even see it available in any of their programs.</p>
<p>Some people regard the Peak Performance Formula as their &#8216;ace in the hole&#8217;?  and swear by it every single day before they hit the gym, when they wake up or even when before playing a recreational sport.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s because (again, due to no fault of your own) this secret was kept hidden from you for so long that you&#8217;ve worked out in weakness and pain all these years.</p>

<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <b>Your Fascial Tissue is HOLDING Your Body Back and Keeping You in Pain</b></span></p>
<div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/021_Fascia1.png" /></div>
<p>What is Fascial Tissue and how does it relate to your performance?</p>
<p>Fascia is an tissue which re-organizes long the lines of tension imposed on your body, adding support to any misalignment and contracting to protect you from further trauma.</p>
<p>To get a better idea of Fascia picture in your mind a sword.</p>
<p>Fascia is the sheath that goes over the sword to protect act as a protectant. Fascia is your sheath protecting and covering every single muscle on your body.</p>
<p>It has been estimated by researchers that if every structure of the body EXCEPT the fascia was removed, the body would STILL retain its shape.</p>
<p>Fascia has the potential to alter your organ and tissue physiology significantly. Any strains in your fascial tissue can slowly <strong>tighten</strong> your body <span style="text-decoration: underline;">causing it to lose it&#8217;s overall ability to perform</span> under any stress.</p>
<p class="vwo_1369612330329 vwo_1369648096922" style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fact</span>: Your Fascial Tissue Affects EVERY Aspect Of Your Life</strong></p>
<p>If your fascial tissue is poor, a tightness will spread over you like a pair of stinky socks or that ugly Christmas sweater that grandma knit you. No offense Grandma.</p>
<p>Your flexibility and ability to move will be depleted inevitably setting you up for more weakness, pain and limited range of motion.</p>
<p class="vwo_1369612342465 vwo_1369648096997" style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center;"><strong>Most of the Population is Suffering From Poor Fascial Tissue</strong></p>
<p>The sad fact is that 90% of the North American population is operating with poorly functioning fascial tissue due to their jobs and namely their &#8216;sitting&#8217;?  lifestyle.</p>
<p>These &#8216;fascial restrictions&#8217;?  are so mutinous that they begin to pull the body out its alignment or in other words it throws your body out of balance resulting in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bad posture</span>.</p>
<p>This results in 90% of the population operating in what&#8217;s termed as a &#8216;biomechanically inefficient&#8217;?  body that uses up MORE energy than it really should.</p>
<p>The restrictions of your fascial tissue create pain throughout the entire body and numerous studies allude to this fact.</p>
<div class="roundbox">One study has found that pain felt in specific areas of the body can be frequently related back to having actual adhesions in the fascial tissue. (Schleip R et al. ligament subfailure injuries lead to muscle control dysfunction&#8217;?  (M. Panjabi). European Spine Journal 2007; 16: 1733-1735)</div>
<p>Things get even worse when they go to the gyms in their poorly functioning bodies and put them through 45 minutes to an hour of intense workouts.</p>
<p>An extremely HIGH percentage of people suffer through pain and loss of motion due to poorly functioning fascial tissue and the intense workouts they do on top of them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a secret either. If you look around you 9 times out of 10 you&#8217;ll find a person with some sort of pain in their body and it&#8217;s mainly due to having poorly functioning fascial tissue.</p>
<p>One way to avoid this problem is to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">massage your fascial tissue</span> on a regular basis or at the very least right before you do any workout session.</p>
<p>Now you may be thinking this, &#8216;<i>I know I should get more massages but massage therapists are expensive I don&#8217;t have the money to pay them every time I need a rub down</i>&#8216;? </p>
<p>Well I&#8217;m here to tell you that you DON&#8217;T need one.</p>
<p>This can be <em>easily</em> remedied by applying the first principle of the Peak Performance formula. But more on that later.<br />

<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <b>You Don&#8217;t Warm Up Before Exercise OR Even WORSE..</b></span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <b>You End Up Warming Up the WRONG Way.</b></span></p>
<p><a href="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/022_WrongWay.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-584" alt="022_WrongWay" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/022_WrongWay.png" width="700" height="259" /></a></p>
<p>A lot of people disregard their warm ups as boring and just a waste of time. When it is, in fact, one of the most IMPORTANT aspects of your workout</p>
<p>Remember that car analogy we used a little earlier?</p>
<p>Not warming up properly (or doing the wrong one) is like taking a car that&#8217;s been sitting in the dead of winter for 8 hours and turning on the ignition and immediately taking it drag racing.</p>
<p>These days your average joe is waking up, going to work, sitting on their butts staring at a computer (while killing their posture) and then hitting the gym for a seriously intense one hour workout WITHOUT effectively warming up their bodies.</p>
<div class="roundbox">
<p>A recent study done by <strong>Arthritis Research UK and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy</strong> asked 2,583 adults and 1,022 children across the UK asked about their physical activity levels over the previous week.</p>
<p>Just <strong>one in five active people</strong> said that they &#8216;always&#8217; warm up and cool down when doing exercise. Some 24 per cent said they &#8216;never do&#8217;. The main reasons given by those who don&#8217;t warm up were &#8216;can&#8217;t be bothered&#8217; (28%) and &#8216;it&#8217;s not important&#8217; (27%). Three quarters (74%) of people who never warm up have not been shown how to do it.</p>
<p>The same study said that many people in the UK may be increasing their risk of injury and joint problems like osteoarthritis in later life by not starting their exercises with a proper warm up.</p>
</div>
<p>The RIGHT warm up prior to any physical activity does a number of beneficial things such as preventing injury, improving performance, raising your core temperature, reducing your muscle stiffness and getting your heart rate up to a workable rate.</p>
<p>BUT its primary purpose is to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wake up your nervous system</span> to be ready for any type of strenuous activity.</p>
<p>What you must know is that warming up is an ESSENTIAL part of your workout and it doesn&#8217;t have to be boring either.</p>
<p>There is a way to get your body warm as well as release a essential fluid your body naturally produces to have it moving freely without obstruction. Keep on reading<br />

<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <b>You STILL Do Static Stretching</b></span></p>
<p class="vwo_1369459414463 vwo_1369648094035">Static stretching <em>was</em> a very popular method used to get your body supple and prepared.</p>
<p class="vwo_group_1369648094035_0">Keep in mind that I said, &#8216;Was&#8217;? .</p>
<p>It was also <em>thought</em> to be useful in preventing injuries. &#8216;Was&#8217;?  being the primary word.</p>
<p>Static stretches are stretches that are usually held for 30 seconds to a minute at a time and if you go to your local gym you&#8217;ll probably find a section with its members doing all sorts of them in a specific stretching area.</p>
<p>However, the reality of things is that <strong>new research proves that static stretching is detrimental to performance and sets up your body for injuries</strong>.</p>
<div class="roundbox">One study on static stretching found that when college athletes used static stretching as a warm up before testing their vertical jump. What they found is that their vertical jump performance is diminished for 15 minutes if performed after using a static stretch program (J Strength Cond Res. 2007 Feb;21(1):223-6.)</div>
<p>When done before any physical activity (especially weight lifting) static stretches actually weaken your muscles and this &#8216;weakening of the muscles&#8217;?  can possibly expose you to greater chance for injury.</p>
<p>Want a little more proof? Look no further than our friends in Scandinavia</p>
<div class="roundbox">
<p>The authors of the study examined articles published over a 44-year period to determine the effect static stretching has on athletes&#8217; strength, power and explosive muscle performance while they&#8217;re engaged in their sport.</p>
<p class="vwo_1369459432262 vwo_1369648094070">It was discovered that static stretching before exercise had a negative impact on athletic performance regardless of the subject&#8217;s age, gender or fitness level. <strong>(Scand J Med Sci Sports 2013 Mar;23(2):131-48.)</strong></p>
</div>
<div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/023_ToeTouch.jpg" /></div>
<p>Traditional stretches, like when people bend over to touch their toes or stretch their legs on a fence, often cause the muscles to <strong>relax</strong> rather than tighten &#8216; which is the EXACT OPPOSITE of what is needed for physical activity.</p>
<p>When you stretch your muscles to their full length you are weakening the force you can contract with while setting them up for possible strain or injury.</p>
<p>Stretching *may* increase the range of motion they can attain, but NOT their ability to stabilize in these new positions. Doing this will limit your performance in any physical activity you choose to perform.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like getting in your car and putting on a seatbelt that doesn&#8217;t function: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You think you&#8217;re protected but you&#8217;re really NOT</span>.</p>
<p>Only the true fitness experts all agree that if you still choose to static stretch before any kind of physical activity that you&#8217;re probably better off not doing it at all.</p>
<p>The key is to keep your stretches short and dynamic while getting your entire body activated through the use of a specific form of mobility exercises.<br />

<p>Now saying &#8216;Secret Weapon&#8217;?  is a bit misleading. It makes it sound like I&#8217;ve discovered some mystical powers that magically transform your body.</p>

<div class="vwo_1369627619366 vwo_1369648097738" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; color: #2e6ffd; text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;">Peak Performance Secret #1</span></span><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;"> Utilize the POWER Of Self Myofascial Release (SMR)</span></div>
<div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/024_TopSecretOne.png" /></div>
<p>Self Myofascial Release is the process of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">massaging yourself</span> using either a foam roller or lacrosse ball and it is by far the best way to heal your poorly functioning fascial tissue.</p>
<p>The best part is that you don&#8217;t need to pay a massage therapist $60 a session and up to do it.</p>
<p>In fact many of my clients do not feel the need to pay for massage therapists after applying the SMR techniques in the Peak Performance Formula.</p>
<p>The beauty of it is that can do SMR in the comfort in your own home or in the gym and it will <strong>help heal your old injuries, prevent any new ones and increase your body&#8217;s ability to lift, move, run, throw and jump</strong>.</p>
<p>SMR smoothes out the dysfunction in your fascial tissue so your muscles are always working at it&#8217;s best peak efficiency all day long.</p>
<p>If you choose to not treat your fascial tissue with SMR it&#8217;s like carrying around a backpack of heavy rocks with you everywhere you go that holds you back from doing tasks, eventually creating pain in the entire body.</p>
<p>Choosing to neglect doing self myofascial release is like saying you don&#8217;t mind living life or doing your workouts halfway and I think we can all agreethat is DEFINITELY not the case.</p>
<p>When you apply SMR to your body you are essentially <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fixing your current fascial issues</span>, healing old adhesions and dysfunctions in the muscle and creating an environment were your body operate at its BEST.</p>
<p>When this happens you actually have MORE strength, speed, flexibility and power because your muscles will fire off in the way it was meant to.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also have MORE energy than ever before because your body will be moving more efficiently FREE of any dysfunction in your muscle tissue.<br />

<span style="color: #0000ff;"> Neuromuscular Activators (NMA&#8217;s)</span></div>
<div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/025_TopSecretTwo.png" /></div>
<p>A Neuromuscular Activator (NMA&#8217;s) is a type of warm up raises your core body temperature, wakes up your nervous system and gets your entire body prepared for any type of stress you place upon it.</p>
<p><strong>Think of this type of warm up program like a &#8216;shot of espresso&#8217;?  but for your body.</strong></p>
<p>Obviously you are aware that your body has a nervous system and after a long period of rest your nervous system needs to do certain exercises to &#8216;wake it up&#8217;? .</p>
<p>NMA type exercises do a great job of &#8216;turning on the switch&#8217;?  for your body energizing it for the task you place in front of it.</p>
<p>NMA&#8217;s do another job for your body: <strong>Lubrication of your joints</strong>.</p>
<p>NMA&#8217;s release something into your body called synovial fluids that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lubricate your joints and make them more pliable for your workouts</span>. You&#8217;ll notice that the warmer you hit a workout you (and your joints) will be more &#8216;ready&#8217;?  for the task.</p>
<p>NMA type of warm ups consist of full body movements that warm up, lubricate and wake up your body so that it is ready to operate at peak efficiency and the BEST part about them is that they <strong>only take 40 seconds to complete</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the second principle of the 6 Minute Performance Formula and a key aspect in getting your body to perform at its best.<br />

<span style="color: #0000ff;"> Dynamic Mobility Exercises</span></div>
<div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/026_TopSecretThree.png" /></div>
<p>This is the third and FINAL principle of the Peak Performance Formula.</p>
<p>Dynamic Mobility exercises are short stretches and muscle activation techniques where the main function is to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">give your body <strong>full range of motion</strong></span> as well as <strong>activate</strong> the muscles that have become dormant due to the &#8216;sitting&#8217;?  nature of today&#8217;s workplace.</p>
<p>Dynamic Mobility exercises are, and should be, an ESSENTIAL part of your workout program and, simply put, they allow your joints move freely.</p>
<p>Their function is to repair and regenerate parts of your body including the cartilage. They do this by increasing your mobility through repair of your joints so you can have the range of motion you were meant to have.</p>
<p>MOST importantly Dynamic Mobility exercises help slow, and in most cases, <strong>REVERSE the aging of your joints</strong> through the transport of detoxifying synovial fluids into your the key areas of your body.</p>
<p>You especially NEED to do the full body Dynamic Mobility drills <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BEFORE your workouts and sports</span> because the short stretches give your body maximum range of motion, which will give your body the best peak performance to work in.</p>
<p>Dynamic mobility essentially improves the way you move throughout life. I cannot stress enough how much better mobility equates to strength and success in any physical activity you do.</p>
<p>If you intend on being active throughout life then you NEED to apply these exercises to your body.<br />

<div style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Putting It Altogether &#8216; The Peak Performance Formula</div>
<div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/027_PuttingAllTogether.png" /></div>
<p>For this we begin with a research study showing the power of doing a 6 Minute Superhuman style program on their bodies before an actual workout.</p>
<p>In the study published in the Journal of Strength &amp; Conditioning Research: <b>(Volume 22 &#8216; Issue 4 &#8216; pp 1286-1297</b>) had 24 NCAA Division 1 wrestlers randomly assigned either a four week 6 Minute Superhuman program or a static stretching program prior to preseason practices</p>
<p>The study was done to determine whether a 6 Minute Superhuman program performed over 4 weeks positively influenced power, speed, agility, endurance, flexibility and strength compared to static stretching or no warm up at all.</p>
<p><b>Group 1 </b>did a 6 Minute Superhuman style program before their workout.</p>
<p><b>Group 2</b> did static stretching before their workout.</p>
<p><b>Group 3 </b>did nothing.</p>
<p>The performance measures were done through a time period of 4 weeks.</p>
<p>Before starting the study they were tested on peak torque of quads, hamstrings, med ball underhand throw, 300 yard shuttle, pull ups, pushups, sit-ups, broad jump, 600m run, sit and reach test, and a trunk extension test.</p>
<p>After the 4 weeks the researchers found <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no differences</span> in performance for the no warm up group but the findings were MORE interesting for the static stretching group. They found that their performance actually got WORSE throughout the 4 week study.</p>
<p><b>As for the 6 Minute Superhuman (6MS) group</b></p>
<p>Wrestlers doing the 4 week <b>6MS program saw improvements across the board</b> in all aspects of performance including:</p>
<p>&#8211; Increase in quad peak torque (+11%)</p>
<p>&#8211; Increase Broad jump (+4%)</p>
<p>&#8211; Increase in sit-ups (+11%)</p>
<p>&#8211; Increase in pushups (+3%),</p>
<p>and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">FASTER</span> sprint times for the 300m shuttle and the 600m run.</p>
<p>They <b>conclusively</b> found that the 6 Minute Superhuman type workouts significantly ENHANCED muscular strength, endurance, flexibility, agility and anaerobic capacity.</p>
<p>In other words, the program made them BETTER athletes all around.</p>
<p>In a second study done from our friends at the <b>Oslo Sports Trauma Research Centre</b> in beautiful Norway, a team lead by Professor T. Soligaard discovered that there was one specific set of exercises that <i>almost</i> made their athletes <span style="text-decoration: underline;">completely impervious</span> to injuries.</p>
<p>The study was done using 125 football clubs (soccer for us North Americans) from all over Norway with over 264 participants that were followed over the course of a year.</p>
<p>They used a comprehensive 6 Minute Superhuman style workout program vs. a static stretching program to test their strength, awareness, and neuromuscular control prior to practices and games.</p>

<p>Quite frankly, the results were INCREDIBLE.</p>
<p>Despite playing a full season of professional football games with 5 day a week practices, the group using 6 Minute Superhuman style exercises had <b>47% LESS injuries (overuse and severe) than the static stretching group</b>.</p>
<p>In fact, one subject named Marie who was always known for being injury-prone and was constantly on the recovery table throughout her previous football seasons.</p>
<p>But after doing the 6MS style exercises she experienced her BEST year ever as a professional football player and didn&#8217;t incur an injury at all in during the year of the study.</p>
<p>She was quoted as saying at the end of the study,</p>
<p>&#8216;<i>At first I thought these exercises were weird and slightly silly but now after doing them I am a believer. The exercises give me the confidence to do what I wanted to on the field without the fear of getting injured. </i></p>
<p><i>I haven&#8217;t felt this confident in my body in a long time. These (the 6MS exercises) have helped me so much that they&#8217;re always going to be a part of my life</i>.&#8217;? </p>
<p>So Marie used these exercises to be a star player on her team while completely <b><i>bulletproofing her bod</i>y</b> in the process. And so can YOU. With the Peak Performance Formula you can live in an athletic body that works even better than it does at this very moment.</p>
<p>Do you see the secret yet?</p>
<p>If not, don&#8217;t worry.</p>
<p>And no, it definitely doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with expensive workout equipment, illegal drugs or useless supplements.</p>
<p>To reveal a little more about the secret, we need to look at this last eye-opening study published in the American Journal of Physiology.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Strathclyde Glasgow tested a 6-Minute-Superhuman style program and its effect on the bodies energy levels during high intense exercise. (<b>Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 279:R899-R906, 2000</b>.)</p>
<p>Six female subjects performed a 30 second sprint at 120% of their max power output on a stationary bicycle exactly five minutes after using a 6MS style exercise program.</p>
<p>The results?</p>
<div class="roundbox">The research showed that they actually found that the body used up <i>less</i> energy during exercise after performing the five minute 6MS program. Even more interesting was that it was suggested that doing the 6MS program before the workout slightly gave an increase to their metabolisms.</div>
<div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/028_All6Subjects.png" /></div>
<p>This groundbreaking group of scientists were able to help <b>all 6 subjects increase their energy levels</b> as well as help them experience a slight increase in their metabolisms..</p>
<p>in ONLY 5 minutes.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why all of our workouts take less than 6 minutes to complete. You don&#8217;t need to do anything complicated or comprehensive. If you have 6 minutes or less to spare then you&#8217;re guaranteed to get amazing results.</p>
<p>No matter what age you are, with this particular formula you can be stronger, faster, more flexible, have more endurance, more energy and more confidence in your body than you ever had.</p>
<p>So what was the secret to the success in all of these studies?</p>
<p>Well it was the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Peak Performance Formula at work!</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 24px;">You Deserve So Much More Than a Life of Age Related Pain, Limited Mobility and Lack Of Energy, Don&#8217;t You?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The fact is this: </span> You don&#8217;t&#8217; have to be like the 99% of the population who blame all of their pain and limited strength to &#8216;aging&#8217;? .</p>
<p>Because just by reading this article you must realize that you can reverse the aging process and become a peak performing human being regardless if you are old age, middle aged or even a teenager.</p>
<p>You can become STRONGER.</p>
<p>You can become FASTER.</p>
<p>You can gain MORE ENERGY and live in a body that feels BETTER than it did in your college or even high school days.</p>
<p>All it takes is a very simple exercise formula and a decision to no longer settle for things as they are. You deserve better and you know this. But you need a plan. You need a <b>blueprint</b> to show you the way to your ultimate peak performing body.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the reason I&#8217;m here. If you&#8217;ll let me, I&#8217;ll be your coach to the greatest body and vitality you could ever have imagined by giving you the keys to the Peak Performance Secret.<br />

<p>Using this formula, you will finally</p>
<p><b style="color: #990000;">Enhance your strength, speed, power, stamina and endless amounts of energy while completely bulletproofing your body from injuries forever..in under 6 minutes.</b></p>
<p>&#8216;<i>C&#8217;mon Dan&#8217;? , you must be thinking, &#8216;There is no way I can achieve all of that in under 6 minutes and actually get results</i>&#8216;? </p>
<p>Hey I understand your skepticism. Even when I read the research studies from those respected scientists there was still a part of me that had its doubts.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m probably sure that we&#8217;ve seen our fair share of fitness fads come and go. Plus, after going through the battle with my own body I was pretty skeptical and had to be critical of every &#8216;workout fad&#8217;?  that came into my path.</p>
<p>There was only one way to find out if this Peak Performance Formula worked for people other than myself, and that was to put them to the test on my own clients. The findings of these tests?</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s safe to say that it&#8217;s now a PROVEN FACT that this simple 6 minute sequence works so well that it MUST become a staple in your program. If you don&#8217;t utilize it it&#8217;s like giving you the keys to a new Ferrari and not even bothering to drive it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll feel BETTER than ever and your body will become an athletic machine from the very short 6 Minute Superhuman workouts because you&#8217;ll harness the power of the Peak Performance Formula, and this involves taking your body to the next level with the simple and fast <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3 Step Sequence of</span></b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span></p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &#8216; Self Myofascial Release (2 minutes)</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &#8216; Neuromuscular Activation (40 seconds)</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &#8216; Dynamic Mobility (3-4 minutes)</p>
<p>You see, the 3 step sequence of Self Myofascial Release, Neuromuscular Activation and Dynamic Mobility is your perfect <b>Peak Performance Formula</b>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about priming yourself in a way that brings your body back into balance in the LEAST amount of timenot just by applying the 3 step sequence but doing it in a way that saves you time that also <b>super charges</b> your performance</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like having a super fast sports car with a nitrous injector on the engine. You press a button and INSTANTLY get an extra 100 Horsepower whenever you need it.</p>
<p>Hundreds of research subjects and only a handful of men and women in the REAL world have felt the age-reversing and performance enhancing effects this simple sequence.</p>
<p>The old sins of working out just do not make sense anymore in today&#8217;s world and if you keep on doing them you might as well not even bother hitting the gym.</p>
<p style="font-size: 24px;" align="center">The 6 Minute Performance Formula Of:<br />
Self Myofascial Release + NMA&#8217;s + Dynamic Mobility<br />
= Your Best Results EVER</p>
<p>And the power of this Peak Performance Formula can be explained by science. As you saw through the research, doing these 3 steps lead to actual <span style="text-decoration: underline;">biomechanical</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">metabolic</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">changes</span>.</p>
<p>These changes in your body are actual things you can feel and measure in your body INSTANTLY.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you choose to do them in the morning, afternoon or before your workouts. Right after applying 6MS to your body you&#8217;ll immediately feel the increased freedom of movement, strength, speed and stamina right away.</p>
<p>The 6 Minute Superhuman system increases your performance by healing the old adhesions and dysfunctions in the muscles and giving you quality fascial tissue to work with, it wakes up your body&#8217;s nervous system, and uses Dynamic Mobility drills to activate your dormant muscles and give you better range of motion.</p>
<p>Now, as opposed to most &#8216;fitness experts&#8217;?  I actually own a gym with hundreds of REAL clients where I can test out these theories on an every day basis.</p>
<p>Since opening up my doors in 2006 I&#8217;ve worked with thousands of clients online and through my gym and put them through years of &#8216;beta testing&#8217;?  to figure out the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perfect performance formula</span>.</p>
<p>These beta tests, combined with 8 years of personal training experience in the 6 Minute Superhuman system have given me practical knowledge of how effective this system isand that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m sharing it with you.</p>
<p><i style="color: #990000;">The reason it only takes 6 minutes is because throughout the years I&#8217;ve honed in the system to be more faster and effective at healing your body moreso than a 30 minute massage and getting your body into optimal performing shape BETTER than your local sports therapist.</i></p>
<p class="vwo_1369453497223 vwo_1369648093348">The <strong>Two Minute Self Myofascial Release</strong> portion of 6MS immediately <span class="vwo_1369648093433" style="text-decoration: underline;">REPAIRS</span> your damaged muscles, REMOVES all adhesions in your muscles that stop it from contracting efficiently AND gives you muscles that fire off at its FULL potential.</p>
<p class="vwo_1369453568060 vwo_1369648093391">The <strong>40 second Neuromuscular Activators</strong> <span class="vwo_1369453490209" style="text-decoration: underline;">WAKE UP</span> your body&#8217;s nervous system and keeps your body pliable by releasing synovial fluid into your body</p>

<em> <img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/quote_2.png" /> </em>Prior to your the 6 Minute Superhuman routine, I&#8217;d often fail to complete a proper warm up. I knew what to do and I&#8217;d do a few dynamic movements, but I always told myself I didn&#8217;t have enough time.</p>
<p class="vwo_1369452212611 vwo_1369452213321 vwo_1369452213654 vwo_1369452221489  vwo_1369452222596 vwo_1369452233881 vwo_1369452239803      vwo_group_1369648094121_0">I was so tight that they would pop, or the tendon would incorrectly glide through.</p>

<p class="vwo_1369648098340">I could never get my body to drastically change in order to meet my goals until Dan Go introduced me, what I now believe, a more advanced level of training and performance with the introduction of his 6 Minute Superhuman system.</p>
<p>I believe there is a lot of general information on exercise widely available on the market.</p>
<p>But the information out there is the &#8216;for dummies&#8217;?  version which if followed is a general mass market health plan and very old school .</p>

<p class="vwo_1369452720540 vwo_1369648093068">Before doing 6MS I struggled to complete some aspects of my workouts. I either had to rest or do an easier version of some exercises.</p>
<p class="vwo_group_1369648093068_0">I often felt my muscles were weak, sore and shaky for a day or two making it difficult for me to exercise at the intensity level I desired. I experienced pain in my knees on numerous occasions when doing exercises like lunges or squats.</p>

<p><b><strong class="vwo_1369452768479 vwo_1369648093207">With the 6MS system I noticed a difference.

<p class="vwo_1369452781399 vwo_1369648093248">This program also made me a believer in the self massage techniques. I have always heard how great a massage is but had never experienced it myself until I started using this.</p>
<p class="vwo_group_1369648093248_0">It has become my favorite part of the routine and I believe it contributes greatly to the success of the program. The 6 Minute Superhuman system is definitely something I will continue to use before my workouts.</p>

<p class="vwo_1369453420722 vwo_1369648093560">After doing the 6MS routine, my muscles aren&#8217;t as tight during and after the workouts. They aren&#8217;t as fatigued, which is what has helped me attend a minimum of 5 boot camp classes per week for our transformation program.</p>
<p class="vwo_group_1369648093560_0">I am sure that the classes alone have helped me drop the weight and build some muscle, but I believe that using the 6 minute superhuman routine has definitely helped.</p>
<p class="vwo_1369453420741 vwo_1369648093606">The dynamic mobility drills prepare my muscles for whatever routine each class brings. I actually have some muscles now, as small as they are.</p>

<p>I purchased 6 Minute Superhuman and am using it at the beginning of my main workouts; so far I am working through the week 1 sequence and am enjoying them. It&#8217;s pretty weird how good I feel right after doing it. One of my favorite exercises is the forward lunge and instep. I also love using them before my mma workout (I practicse brazillian jiu jitsu and kickboxing). It just feels great and I can&#8217;t believe I haven&#8217;t been using this this whole time.</p>

<div style="font-size: 18px; color: #990000;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/quote_2.png" /> I do these right before my circuit training workouts</div>
<p>I can remember thinking at the time that the workouts didn&#8217;t look very hard and I wondered whether they would even work. Anyway I decided to try them and I can&#8217;t believe how effective they are. What I love about them is that they are intense and they get me primed and ready for my circuit training workouts P.S. Many people attending the gym I go to are doing the same old traditional warm ups, particularly the females (jogging and stretching). I actually feel sorry for them because I&#8217;ve been there and done that &amp; it wasn&#8217;t very effective. Now I have 6 Minute Superhuman and it makes a big difference.&#8217;? </p>

<p><!-- DOES IT REALLY TAKE JUST SIX MINUTES ENDS HERE --></p>
<p><!-- WHAT IF THESE 6 MINUTE WORKOUTS DON'T WORK FOR ME STARTS HERE --></p>
<p style="font-size: 32px; color: #990000;" align="center"><b>What if These 6 Minute Workouts<br />
Don&#8217;t Work for Me?</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, 99% of the workout programs you see on the market today FAIL to incorporate the <b>Peak Performance Formula</b>.</p>
<p>This is the #1 reason why you do their workouts and either don&#8217;t get results (because your body doesn&#8217;t function properly) or you are simply left in pain after every session due to not applying any of the peak performance principles.</p>
<p>Even IF you got results from your program (and that&#8217;s a big IF) then you&#8217;d still be left wit a body that is weak and lacks energy. And I think we can all agree that there is no point to &#8216;looking&#8217;?  good if you end up feeling like crap.</p>
<p>But when you regularly use the <b>Peak Performance Formula </b>you&#8217;ll unlock your body&#8217;s true potential and have it operating at its best, FULL of energy without any pain whatsoever.</p>
<p>This formula is the one critical element missing from every single one of the workout programs out there.<br />
<!-- WHAT IF THESE 6 MINUTE WORKOUTS DON'T WORK FOR ME ENDS HERE --></p>
<p><!-- DO YOU HAVE 6 MINUTES TO SPARE STARTS HERE --></p>
<p style="font-size: 32px; color: #990000;" align="center"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do You Have 6 Minutes to Spare?</span></b></p>
<p>How long does it take you to brush your teeth?</p>
<p>How long does it take to choose an outfit for work and get changed?</p>
<p>How long does it take to stand in line at Starbucks and get a coffee?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to take a guess and say that they all take AT LEAST 6 minutes or MORE.</p>
<p>In the 6 Minute Superhuman program, you&#8217;re going to get rid of all of those nagging pains hampering your body every day and prevent new ones from happening without any trips to your doctor or chiropractor.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll reach your ultimate potential of strength, speed, and flexibility without the use of expensive supplements or dangerous (and illegal) injections.</p>
<p>Your body will be completely enhanced in every physical way possible with the natural boost these workouts deliver. These workouts won&#8217;t leave you feeling broken or drained like most high volume training programs out there.</p>
<p>Instead, you&#8217;ll find an increase in your energy whether you working out in the gym, playing with your kid or even fooling around with your spouse &#8216; <i>all day</i> and <i>all nigh</i>t long. With these new increases in energy you&#8217;ll be up for anything life puts in your way.<br />
<!-- DO YOU HAVE 6 MINUTES TO SPARE ENDS HERE --><br />
<!-- THE TRUTH IS --></p>
<p style="font-size: 32px; color: #990000;" align="center"><b>The Truth Is.</b></p>
<p>This is the only program of its kind being offered of its kind. The other TRUTH is that most &#8216;fitness experts&#8217;?  and &#8216;personal trainers&#8217;?  have no idea about these types of workouts.</p>
<p style="font-size: 24px;"><b>The saddest thing about most workout programs is that they are using workout systems that are meant to break the body down and yet ignore the advantage of the Peak Performance Formula.</b></p>
<p>There is even one popular circuit training workout (name withheld) spreading worldwide that is giving Chiropractors and Physiotherapists BIG business due to the intense nature of their workouts and lack of attention on using the Peak Performance Formula.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I know a doctor in Orange County that ONLY treats this franchises clients injuries and he is booked SOLID.</p>
<p>He once told one me that he wouldn&#8217;t have half of his business if that program (name of popular circuit training program) didn&#8217;t get as popular as it is today.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even sadder is that pain is accepted across the board with all of their clients. They *think* they are working out to be elite athletes but 99% of them end up with broken bodies as result.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that if you can&#8217;t avoid sitting and if you still intend on being active then the Peak Performance Formula MUST be an essential part of your life.</p>
<p style="font-size: 24px; color: #990000;"><b>Life is Way Too Short to Try And Learn This On Your Own Through Trial And Error. Why Not Learn From My Mistakes?</b></p>
<div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/030_PullUps.png" /></div>
<p>Look, by now you know that sitting affects our performance in every aspect of life and unless you intend on quitting your job, staying away from browsing the internet or never watching TVsitting cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>You also know that if you intend to be active in life, whether it be in the gym, playing sports or playing with your kids you&#8217;ll need apply the Peak Performance Formula to keep up with those demands on your body and maintain high energy levels.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s still <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one more truth </span>to make the case for applying the techniques of the <b>Peak Performance Formula</b> and here it is</p>
<p>Why go through years of trial and error when you can &#8216; in a matter of minutes &#8216; read this manual (or watch the follow along videos) and master the performance secrets known by less than 1% of the population?</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll then parlay this newfound knowledge your newfound skills into a finely tuned body, endless energy and a pain free life in a matter of a few short weeks.</p>
<p>This is EXACTLY the kind of inner circle information I wish I had 8 years ago when I was just getting started.</p>
<p>Learning even one or two of steps of the Peak Performance Formula would have let me avoid the year of frustration and doubt I had about my body. This is information that most people NEVER discover by trying to do it on their own.<br />
<!-- THE TRUTH IS ENDS HERE --></p>
<p><!-- HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO HIRE... STARTS HERE --></p>
<p style="font-size: 24px;" align="center"><b>How Much Would it Cost to Hire a Trainer</b><br />
<b>That DOESN&#8217;T Know the Peak Performance Formula?</b></p>
<div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="http://6minutesuperhuman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/031_video.png" /></div>
<p>What would you say the going rate for a trainer in your area runs for? $45 per session? $65? $100 for 45 minutes?</p>
<p>Back when I was training clients in my small town of Markham, a single personal training session with a brand new trainer started at $60 a session and this is with someone who just took a weekend course to get certified.</p>
<p>So for far a fraction of the cost of a single session with a ROOKIE personal trainer (that hasn&#8217;t got any clue about the Peak Performance Secret), you&#8217;ll get the scientifically PROVEN 6 Minute Superhuman System that will last you for your entire life.</p>
<p>Plus the 6 Minute Superhuman program delivers support and holds you by the hand (through the follow along videos) so you can increase your performance and finally turn back the clock on your body in the time it takes to get a coffee at your local Starbucks.</p>
<p>If you were to pay an unproven trainer $60 a session for 18 workouts (6 weeks x 3 sessions a week), you would invest over $1080 . And they would probably leave you worse for wear after they were done with you. To top it all off they wouldn&#8217;t even guarantee their results.<br />
<!-- HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO HIRE... ENDS HERE --></p>
<p><!-- I WILL TAKE YOU BY THE HAND... STARTS HERE --></p>
<p class="vwo_1369453974941 vwo_1369648093705" style="font-size: 24px;" align="center"><b>I Will Take You By The Hand And Teach You The Proven</b><br />
<b>Techniques Of the Strongest, Healthiest, and Most Energetic People on</b> <b>Earth Cutting Edge Information </b><b>&#8216;Straight From the Trenches&#8217;? </b></p>
<p>These are not theories written by some science geek in a white lab coat who has never worked with a client in real life. I practice what I preach and use this system myself.</p>
<p>I currently exercise at least 1-2 hours per day 7 days a week, and I need to be following the proper type of workout plan to maximize my performance and reduce my recovery time.</p>
<p>But the real beauty about this is that I have applied this Peak Performance Formula with countless other people from all walks of life to help them boost their athleticism, skyrocket their energy, and dramatically improve their health and quality of life!</p>
<p>Does it make sense to listen to the &#8216;armchair experts&#8217;?  who ramble endlessly about their theories while they&#8217;re secretly living with broken down bodies?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just not worth it. Not when you have the Peak Performance Formula at your disposal in the comfort of your own home.<br />
